      <h1><a href="../classes/Wee.html">Wee</a> Web Framework</h1>
<h2>Copyright and License</h2>
<p>

Released under the same terms of license as Ruby.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Wee.html">Wee</a> is a light-weight, very high-level
and modern web-framework that makes <b>W</b>eb <b>e</b>ngineering
<b>e</b>asy. It mainly inherits many ideas and features from <a
href="http://seaside.st/">Seaside</a>, but was written from scratch without
ever looking at the Seaside (or any other) sources. All code was developed
from ideas and lots of discussions with Avi Bryant.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Reusable components</h3>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Wee.html">Wee</a> has <em>real</em> components, which
are like widgets in a GUI. Once written, you can use them everywhere. They
are completely independent and do not interfere with other components.
Components encapsulate state, a view and actions. Of course you can use an
external model or use templates for rendering.
</p>
<h3>Backtracking</h3>
<p>
See the <em>What is backtracking?</em> section below. In short,
backtracking lets the browser&#8216;s back and forward-button play well
together with your application.
</p>
<h3>Clean and concise</h3>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Wee.html">Wee</a> is well thought out, is written in
<b>and</b> supports clean and concise code. Furthermore I think most parts
are now very well documented.
</p>
<h3>Templating-independent</h3>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Wee.html">Wee</a> does not depend on a special
templating-engine. You can use a different templating engine for each
component if you want.
</p>
<h3>Powerful programmatic HTML generation</h3>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Wee.html">Wee</a> ships with an easy to use and very
powerful programmatic HTML-generation library. For example you can create a
select list easily with this piece of code:
</p>
<pre>
   # select an object from these items
   items = [1, 2, 3, 4]

   # the labels shown to the user
   labels = items.map {|i| i.to_s}

   # render it
   r.select_list(items).labels(labels).callback {|choosen| p choosen}

   # render a multi-select list, with objects 2 and 4 selected
   r.select_list(items).multi.labels(labels).selected([2,4])
</pre>
<p>
The callback is called with the selected objects from the <em>items</em>
array. Items can be any object, even whole components:
</p>
<pre>
   labels = [&quot;msg1&quot;, &quot;msg2&quot;]
   items = labels.collect {|m| MessageBox.new(m)}
   r.select_list(items).labels(labels).callback {|choosen| call choosen.first}
</pre>
<h2>Observations and Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Components are thread-safe by nature as a fresh components-tree is created
for each session and requests inside a session are serialized.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is backtracking?</h2>
<p>
If you want, you can make the back-button of your browser work correctly
together with your web-application. Imagine you have a simple counter
application, which shows the current count and two links <em>inc</em> and
<em>dec</em> with which you can increase or decrease the current count.
Starting with an inital count of 0 you increase the counter up to 8, then
click three times the back button of your browser (now displays 5). Finally
you decrease by one and your counter shows what you&#8216;d have expected:
4. In contrast, traditional web applications would have shown 7, because
the back button usually does not trigger a HTTP request and as such the
server-side state still has a value of 8 for the counter when the request
to decrease comes in.
</p>
<p>
The solution to this problem is to take snapshots of the components state
after an action is performed and restoring the state before peforming
actions. Each action generates a new state, which is indicated by a
so-called <em>page-id</em> within the URL.
</p>
<h2>Decorations</h2>
<p>
Decorations are used to modify the look and behaviour of a component
without modifying the components tree itself. A component can have more
than one decoration. Decorations are implemented as a linked list
(Wee::Decoration#next points to the next decoration), starting at
Wee::Component#decoration, which either points to the next decoration in
the chain, or to itself.
</p>
<h2>The request/response cycle</h2>
<p>
The request/response cycle in <a href="../classes/Wee.html">Wee</a> is
actually split into two separate phases.
</p>
<h3>Render Phase</h3>
<p>
The rendering phase is assumed to be side-effect free! So, you as a
programmer should take care to meet this assumption. Rendering is performed
by method Wee::Component#render_on.
</p>
<h3>Action Phase (Invoking Callbacks)</h3>
<p>
Possible sources for callbacks are links (anchors) and all kinds of
form-elements like submit buttons, input-fields etc. There are two
different kinds of callbacks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Input callbacks (input-fields)

</li>
<li>Action callbacks (anchor, submit-button)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The distinction between input and action callbacks is important, as action
callbacks might depend on values of input-fields being assigned to instance
variables of the controlling component. Hence, <a
href="../classes/Wee.html">Wee</a> first invokes all input callbacks before
any action callback is triggered. Callback processing is performed by
method Wee::Component#process_callbacks.
</p>
<p>
The result of the action phase is an updated components state. As such, a
snapshot is taken of the new state and stored under a new page-id. Then, a
redirect requests is sent back to the client, including this new page-id.
The client automatically follows this redirect and triggers a render phase
of the new page.
