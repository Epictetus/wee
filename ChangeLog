	* added wee/databases/og.rb, which defines OgApplication and
	  OgSession, as well as a generic (but still very limited)
	  OgScaffolder. 

	* Methods Wee::Session#sleep and #awake added, which are called before and
	  after the request is handled. They can be used for example to setup
	  and release a database connection.

	* require 'wee/utils' will load all utility methods.
